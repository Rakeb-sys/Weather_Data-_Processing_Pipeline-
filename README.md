Data Engineering Intern Assignment 
Case Study: Weather Data Processing Pipeline 
Objective: Build a simple data pipeline to ingest, clean, transform, and analyze weather data from 
a CSV file, saving the processed results as output files. 
Tools and Technologies: 
• Programming Language: Python (using Pandas and NumPy) 
• Output Format: CSV or JSON files 

*************************
Prerequisite:
1. Install python from python official site, https://www.python.org/
2. To check proper installation of your python : open command prompt and on administrator account type python -V
   this will return your installed python version
3. Install Anaconda Navigator and  open Jupyter Notebook

*********************************************
Step-by-step instructions to run the pipeline locally
1. install required libraries: panda, numpy and matplotlib as !pip install pandas , !pip install numpy and !pip install matplotlib respectively
2. Download and open Weather_Data_Processing_Pipeline.ipynb file 
3. Put the dataset (weather_data.csv) in the same folder with Weather_Data_Processing_Pipeline.ipynb
4. Run the Weather_Data_Processing_Pipeline.ipynb and it will return a bar chart of Average Temperature per City
